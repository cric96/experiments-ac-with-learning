# Experiments of Aggregate Computing combined with AI 

This repository contains experiments in which we explore the combination of declarative collective programming approach (Aggregate Computing)
with AI techniques.

Each experiment is self-contained in a branch. The branch name tries to clarify the experiment extent (e.g. gradient-regression).

A branch that ends with *primer* contains basic configuration for a certain technology/framework

In the main branch, I try to maintain the list of experiments done with their status/important things discovered.
