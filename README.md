# Experiments of Aggregate Computing combined with AI 

This repository contains experiments in which we explore the combination of declarative collective programming approach (Aggregate Computing)
with AI techniques.

Each experiment is self-contained in a branch. The branch name tries to clarify the experiment extent (e.g. gradient-regression).

Each branch that ends with *primer* contains the basic configuration for a certain technology/framework

In the main branch, I try to maintain the list of experiments done with their status/important things discovered.

## [Hop count regression](https://github.com/cric96/experiments-ac-with-learning/tree/hop-count-regression)

This branch contains the experiment in which I try to learn the hop count function using a standard regressor. This is the first attempt to mix AC with standard ML technique, so it is a only a PoF.
### <span style="color:yellow">Status</span>
On validation.
#### <span style="color:gray">Things discovered</span> 
Nothing special. Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/cric96/experiments-ac-with-learning/tree/hop-count-regression#readme) in the hop count branch.
